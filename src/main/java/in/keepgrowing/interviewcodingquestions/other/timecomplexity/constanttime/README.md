# Constant Time

An algorithm is said to be constant time (also written as `O(1)` time) if the value of T(n) is bounded by a value that
does not depend on the size of the input. For example, accessing any single element in an array takes constant time as
only one operation has to be performed to locate it. In a similar manner, finding the minimal value in an array sorted
in ascending order; it is the first element.

Despite the name "constant time", the running time does not have to be independent of the problem size, but an upper
bound for the running time has to be independent of the problem size.
