# Linear Time

For an algorithm that takes linear time, or `O(n)` time, the running time increases at most linearly with the size of
the input. For example, a procedure that adds up all elements of a list requires time proportional to the length of the
list, if the adding time is constant, or, at least, bounded by a constant.

Linear time is the best possible time complexity in situations where the algorithm has to sequentially read its entire
input.
