# Comparators in Java

Comparators can be passed to a `sort` method (such as `Collections.sort` or `Arrays.sort`) to allow **precise control**
over the sort order.

Comparators can also be used to control the order of certain data structures (such as sorted sets or sorted maps), or to
provide an ordering for collections of objects that **don't have a natural ordering**.
