# Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such
as madam or racecar. There are also numeric palindromes, including date/time stamps using short digits 11/11/11 11:11
and long digits 02/02/2020. For example; Tuesday, 22 February 2022 is considered a palindrome day (22022022 using
dd-mm-yyyy format) as it can be read from left to right or vice versa. Sentence-length palindromes ignore
capitalization, punctuation, and word boundaries.
