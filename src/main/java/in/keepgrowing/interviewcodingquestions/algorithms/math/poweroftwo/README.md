# Power of two

A power of two is a number of the form 2n where n is an integer, that is, the result of exponentiation with number two
as the base and integer n as the exponent.

In a context where only integers are considered, n is restricted to non-negative values, so we have 1, 2, and 2
multiplied by itself a certain number of times.
