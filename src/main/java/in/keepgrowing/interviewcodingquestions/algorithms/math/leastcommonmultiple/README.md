# Least common multiple

The least common multiple of two integers is the smallest positive integer between all the multiples of both. It is
usually written as LCM(a, b). Likewise, the LCM of more than two integers is the smallest positive integer that is
divisible by each of them.

In elementary arithmetic, the LCM is also the "lowest common denominator" (LCD) that must be calculated, before
fractions can be added, subtracted or compared.

It is known that:

`GCD(a,b)*LCM(a,b)=
`

where `GCD(a,b)` is
the [greatest common divisor](src/main/java/in/keepgrowing/interviewcodingquestions/algorithms/math/greatestcommondivisor)
of a and b, This formula is often used to compute the LCM, by first finding the GCD of a and b.
