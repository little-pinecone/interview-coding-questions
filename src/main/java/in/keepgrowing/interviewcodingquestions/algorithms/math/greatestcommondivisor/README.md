# Greatest common divisor

The greatest common divisor (GCD) or highest common factor (HCF) of two integers x and y is the largest number that
divides both of the integers evenly. GCDs are useful in simplifying fractions to the lowest terms.

[Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) uses repeated long division in order to find
the greatest common factor of two numbers.
