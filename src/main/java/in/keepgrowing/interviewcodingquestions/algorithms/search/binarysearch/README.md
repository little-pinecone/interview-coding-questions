# Binary search

A method used for finding an item in a sorted list. It is an algorithm that is more efficient than linear search (which
will go through every item in the list of items to find a particular item). However, the given list of items must be
sorted first before a binary search algorithm can be used.

The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly splitting the sorted list into two and working on the part of the list
that may contain the item that you are looking for until the final list contains only one item.
