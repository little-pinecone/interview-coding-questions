# Linear search

Linear search or sequential search is a method to find an item in a list. It is a search algorithm.

## Steps

Start out with a list, L which may have the item that we want to look for.

* If the list L is empty, then the list has nothing. The list does not have the item that we are looking for, so we stop
  here.
* If the list L is not empty, we look at all the elements in the list. For each element:
  If the element equals the item that we are looking for, the list has the item in question, so we will stop here and
  return the position in the list that has the element that we are looking for. If not, we will go on to the next
  element.
* When we reached the end of the list and still have not found the element that we are looking for, then the list does
  not have the item that we want.
