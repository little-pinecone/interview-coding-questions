# Power set

In mathematics, the power set (or powerset) of a set S is the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S
itself.

# Examples

* The power set of `{2, 5}` is `{{}, {2}, {5}, {2, 5}}`.
* The power set of `{3, 4, 10}` is `{{}, {3}, {4}, {10}, {3, 4}, {3, 10}, {4, 10}, {3, 4, 10}}`.
