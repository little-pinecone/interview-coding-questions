# interview-coding-questions

[![keep growing logo](readme-images/logo_250x60.png)](https://keepgrowing.in)

Code examples solving common interview questions.

This repository is based on the work done in
the [trekhleb/javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms)
project, but presents example implementations in Java.

This project is meant to be used for **learning and researching purposes only**.
